# We require more than 8 characters because hackers have lists
# of all password 8 characters and fewer and ways to crack them.
#
# We know users are confused by upper/lower case so we use only lowercase,
# and by letters vs. numbers like "oh" and "zero" so we use only letters.
# We choose this as an acceptable tradeoff between usability and complexity.
#
# We choose 10 characters to make a sufficiently strong password
# for typical web applications. 
#
# Example:
#   Password.new => "vyzwbjxrem"
#
